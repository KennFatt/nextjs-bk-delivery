## BurgerKing's Delivery Clone

*A clone (interface and not fufirefxnctionalities) of [BurgerKing's Delivery website](https://bkdelivery.co.id/). Written in NextJS and TailwindCSS*.



**Disclaimer!**

- Everything I do is pure for learning purpose.
- All assets are belongs to Burger King's company. No assets are taken or hosted, if in future some images are broken it might be they change their policy or the images are deleted on their server.
- There is no functionality, yet. It's essentially how I want to build the website interface and experience.



### ðŸŽ‡ Goals

- Building a website with NextJS and implements [data fetching](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md) mechanism.
  - `getStaticProps()`
  - `getStaticPaths()`
- Use [Firebase's Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) as the API endpoint.
